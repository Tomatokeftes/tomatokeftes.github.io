I am excited to announce to that our tutorial paper on how to apply Random Forest classifiers to ToF-SIMS imaging data has been published at JASMS and can be found <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jasms.4c00324" target="_blank"> here</a> . Analysis of ToF-SIMS datasets can be quite challenging due to the lack or low intensity of molecular ions and the abundance of fragments leading to highly dimensional and highly collinear data. While Random Forest models have some robustness against these problems, we show that we can improve the performance of our classifier model by setting collinearity thresholds and removing redundant features. At the same time this leads to a cheaper & simpler model to train with less overfitting. What's there not to like?
