A new paper that we worked on has been published at JASMS, titled: Mass Spectrometry Imaging for Spatial Ingredient Classification in Plant-Based Food. Ever wondered how we can apply ML on MSI data for classification of constituents? In this paper we show three approaches to do this. Firstly an unsupervised approach to figure out the hetereogeneity or adulteration of your samples. Secondly a semi-supervised approach to train and identify ingredients in plant-based burger. Finally, a supervised approach to figure out important peaks that can separate between different samples or, in our cases, different burgers.
